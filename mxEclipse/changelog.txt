***** 2006-08-12

There are some new features of the plugin I would like to share with you:
- Description and State columns added
- Delete action ( ) - will delete the current object (confirm dialog first)
- Connect Existing action ( ) - will open a dialog where a user can search


  Content of this dialog is sensitive on the preselected items - for instance relationship dialog will contain only those logical relationships for the object selected before the popup is invoked, and for the direction of relationship - left upper corner. After search, and selection of an object, click on OK button will connect it to the object in the MxObject view.

- Table Columns chooser ( ) - will open a dialog that enables a user to choose columns and layout to be shown:

        Columns can be set to invisible, and also can be defined for object or relationship. Also, width can be predefined. On clicking OK, MxObjet view's treetable will be updated, but also the settings will be stored as a preference, so after the eclipse restart the settings will stay, and can be edited in the same dialog. Here is the look of table after applying the changes:



***** 2006-11-03

There is a new version of mxeclipse containing following new features:
- Disconnect button available    - will disconnect selected object's relationship to parent object in the treee view. User will be prompted first:

- Tree table instead of tree - columns are movable and sortable:


***** 2006-10-23

- Filter functionality ( )   - you can filter by object/relationship name/attributes as well as rel directions - this filter will be taken into account on expand of relationships.

(planned is to have possibility to store/retreive filters, not done yet)

- Changes on object/relationship attributes are tracked in the gui (  - for modified, but still not saved). Also notice (*) sign in the header of the view.

 - Save attributes on objects & relationships from the gui ( ). All the pending attributes are save to the database.
- Shortcuts when you are on the view:
	- Ctrl+F = find objects dialog
	- Ctrl+S = save object & relationship attributes


***** 2006-10-06

- expand in the list of objects - just double click on an obect, or use popup menu expand action - it can be nested...

- Relationship tab will show information on the relationship coming to the selected object (relationship direction is also shown in the tree on the left side, as well as it's name).
- Silent login - in the preferences dialog, there is additional flag (Automatically log in without dialogs). This one will just log you in without need to press login button, any time logged in user is needed. You will not be logged out automatically.


You can get it from the same folder: /pcpdev/mxeclipse/install/plugins/com.scandent.mxeclipse_10.6.2.0.jar

***** 2006-09-25

There is a new version containing split view for business, objects, and mql.
Also, properties for objects contain attributes (readonly for now) and history working tabs. MQL view contains fully functional MQL client. History arrow up/down buttons also work.

***** 2006-09-22

Please notice that there is another project in our pcpdev repository: mxeclipse. The intention is to have matrix plugin for eclipse. I got the initial source code from Tom, and added some more functionality. It is far from finished but you can use it in current state.
Just save the jar file shown in the picture to your plugins folder (you can put it in eclipse or in thirdparty/AdditionalExtensions/eclipse/plugins).


There are four buttons on top you can use (connect to matrix, disconnect, import programs to your project, save programs - useful one, you can just save a JPO that you are editing to matrix).
There is also another MxEclipse view (you should take it from Window->Open View for the first time). It allows search by admin/business objects. Admin doesn't work for all, and no properties are shown.
Business object search is the part I did (the form doesn't look very nice but does the job - you can search by id - if no ids given you can type: type-name-revison combination. A click on the result's row will give you (currently only basic) information about the object.
